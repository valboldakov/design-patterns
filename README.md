# Design Principles

- Encapsulate What Varies.
- Program to an Interface, not an Implementation.
- Favor Composition Over Inheritance.
- Favor Loose Coupling of the Interacting Objects.
- Classes should be closed for modification but open for extension.

## Strategy Pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Observer Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

## Decorator Pattern

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
