# Design Principles

- Encapsulate What Varies.
- Program to an Interface, not an Implementation.
- Favor Composition Over Inheritance.
- Favor Loose Coupling of the Interacting Objects.
- Classes should be closed for modification but open for extension.
- High-level classes shouldn’t depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Strategy Pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Observer Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

## Decorator Pattern

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.


## Factory Method Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


## Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.


## Singleton Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
